A User's Guide for this MATLAB visualization code is forthcoming.  For now, one
may type 'help <whatever>.m' (where <whatever> is some file beginning with ath_)
to see a brief explanation of the purpose and syntax.  NOTE:  Two files contain
information on the type of the binary data (single or double precision) and 
currently must be modified by hand.  (The default is type double.  To change to
type single, modify the variable realtype in ath_init_grid.m and ath_readbin.m)
